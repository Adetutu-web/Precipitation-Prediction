# Precipitation-Predictions-using-ML-from-scratch
Implemented supervised learning model on precipitation dataset (having significant imbalance between number of each class examples) from scratch using pandas Numpy and matplotlib only and achieved aprox 87% of accuracy
## This file will guide you for project and Carries som intuition behind decisions that i took in projec
*In this project i am using python, pandas matplotlib for for data analysis and cleaning and implemeted algorithm from scratch* 

*to overcome the imbalance between each class examples we have upsampled our minority class for better predictions accuracy*

*we are having dataset with around 1800 examples and having 15 features of course all of them are not worth predicting the 
target variable(PRCP) so we used Chi-square technique to predict which feature we are going feed in algorithm*
